+# PATCH: statically link OpenMP into vss0 (for MacOS only)
+# On Macs, OpenMP_CXX_LIBRARIES always ends in .dylib for some reason,
+# to target_link_libraries will dynamically link openmp. This isn't ideal
+# for pre-compiled SQLite extensions, since users will have to 
+# "brew install libomp", which doesn't always work. So this patch is included
